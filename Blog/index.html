<h1> Philadelphia Billboard Study </h1>
<br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Philadelphia is a city covered with an abundance of outdoor advertising signs across its landscape. At least 1,917 sign faces in Philadelphia are owned by just the top 4 operators. According to Jared Brey from PlanPhilly, “that’s an average of 13 billboards per square mile, if evenly spread out.”

  The opportunity for new legislation brings the chance for additional policy changes, such as existing tax policies. Currently the city generates no greater revenue from billboards than any other business. A 7% excise tax is paid on billboards but only by the advertisers not operators. This 7% tax is equivalent to the rate of sales tax which is not applicable to the industry. Owners only need to pay a permitting fee of $650, and then an annual fee of $150 which can only be used to fund enforcement, not revenue. These fees are also accompanied by the typical commercial and business revenue taxes paid for any business.

<h3>Analysis of the Digital Trade In Legislation</h3>
<p>
  City council passed a revision ot the zoning code in 2015 allowing a two for one digital conversion policy. This policy would result in many of the billboards in weak and mid markets being traded toward the conversion of existing static signs in strong market locations. The maps to the right reflect what areas area represented by potential sending and receiving locations if such a trade-in policy as recommended in the 2015 legislation were actually placed into effect without any constraint under the current financial estimates.

  Under a trade-in for digital policy every weak and many of the mid-market locations depicted in blue could be available and would likely be financially worthwhile to trade-in for a new digital location. The revenue they generate as static signs is consistently lower than what a digital sign in a strong market area would produce. The overwhelming supply of viable signs for trade in makes it difficult to evaluate the location and net gain that a trade-in policy would generate.
